we need to figure out how we're going to grab info from Sonic Retro
we need to figure out how we're going to deal with arcade game scanboxes; or maybe we shouldn't though some things like Mega Play have boxes
somehow produce a link to the front page in the site title
can possibly optimize game names by only stripping _ when displaying the report
possibly reduce some panics and have them reported as errors
possibly have the templates write to a temporary buffer instead of directly to the http.ResponseWriter for the sake of error checking
handle manuals, when we figure out what to do with them
split out user-controllable parameters somehow
should I just not worry about comments or nowiki? It'd help catch real TODOs and errors
still hardcodes /scans/ in templates
