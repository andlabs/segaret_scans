we need to figure out how we're going to grab info from Sonic Retro
we need to figure out how we're going to deal with arcade game scanboxes; or maybe we shouldn't though some things like Mega Play have boxes
pageTitle can be refactored to produce the Sega Retro bit itself

possibly reduce some panics and have them reported as errors
possibly have the templates write to a temporary buffer instead of directly to the http.ResponseWriter for the sake of error checking
handle manuals, when we figure out what to do with them
